    Functionally equivalent to reading the corresponding `coach://` MCP

    Read this whenever you need:
    - 'user_profile' — the athlete's max HR, zone boundaries, race PRs,
      lactate test data, derived HR target bands.
    - 'training_philosophy' — the Bakken Norwegian threshold framework,
      session formats, weekly structure, recovery cues.
    - 'classification' — workout type rules, naming conventions, target
      zone distribution bands for weekly summaries.
    - 'plan_design' — structural reference for designing a multi-week
      training block. Read before drafting `plan.json`: block archetypes,
      X-økt rotation, weekly templates, race-prep 12-week structure.

    A good pattern at the start of a coaching conversation is to read
    'user_profile' + 'training_philosophy' before answering anything that
    depends on the athlete's thresholds or framework. Read 'plan_design'
    additionally when drafting or revising a training block.

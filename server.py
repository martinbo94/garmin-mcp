SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS = """
This server is the user's personal running coach setup. It hosts:
- `coach://` resources: training_philosophy (Bakken Norwegian threshold
  framework), user_profile (lab-calibrated zones, paces, race PRs,
  athlete profile A/B/C), plan_design, classification.
- Tools for Garmin activity/wellness data, Strava sync, plan management.

ROUTING RULES — read before any analytical task:

1. HR ZONES, PACES, ATHLETE PROFILE come from `get_athlete_profile`
   (or `coach://user_profile`). NEVER use Strava's athlete zones — they
   reflect Strava settings, not the user's lab-calibrated thresholds.
   Strava's max HR is typically a recent race HR, not the user's true
   max, so its zones are systematically shifted 5-10 bpm low.

2. ACTIVITY ANALYSIS: prefer `activity_breakdown(strava_id)` over raw
   Strava streams. It returns lap classification (drag/pause/wu/cd),
   zone time, and session category in one call, anchored to the user's
   actual zones.

3. RECOVERY / READINESS: `morning_check_in` returns flat HRV, RHR, sleep
   score + stages, Garmin training_status (PEAKING / PRODUCTIVE / etc.),
   training_summary, and 7-day trend deltas with deviation flags. Pull
   this BEFORE setting race goals or deciding whether to push a quality
   session.

4. WEEKLY VOLUME / ZONE TIME: `weekly_summary` (this server, anchored to
   user_profile zones), not Strava's raw activity list.

5. STRAVA is SECONDARY — useful for segments, GPS detail, social, or
   activities outside the local cache window.

PRE-ANALYSIS PROTOCOL (race goal, weekly review, plan tweak):
  a. `get_athlete_profile` — lock in zones, paces, PRs, profile A/B/C.
  b. `morning_check_in` — current readiness.
  c. `weekly_summary` for the relevant window — volume + zone trend.
  d. `activity_breakdown` for the specific reference sessions.
  e. THEN reason — not before.

INTERPRETATION RULES (apply when reasoning over activity data):

- For interval/quality sessions, ALWAYS use the drag laps' `avg_hr` from
  `activity_breakdown.laps`, NEVER the session-wide `avg_hr`. The
  session average is diluted by warmup, cooldown, and recovery jogs, so
  it systematically understates working HR. A 3×6 min sub-threshold
  session can show session avg 165 bpm while the reps themselves were
  at 184. Conclude "not a threshold session" from session avg = a
  classic error.
- When a rep's `avg_hr` lands on a zone boundary, check its `max_hr`
  too. HR-lag often produces low-Z2 avg with mid-Z3+ max on the first
  rep — that's still a working rep (the `activity_breakdown`
  classifier already rescues these into `drag` via the pace co-signal).
- The `session_category` field is heuristic from aggregate zones; it
  can read "easy" for sessions whose reps WERE threshold-level if the
  rep fraction was small. Always inspect `laps` for sessions with
  interval-style names (Intervaller, Tempo, etc.).

ATHLETE PROFILE matters for race-goal estimation:
- Profile A (VO2-strong, utilization-weak): Riegel/VDOT tend to
  OVERESTIMATE. Hitting-the-wall history common — bias goals slightly
  conservative.
- Profile B (utilization-strong, VO2-weak): Riegel tends to underestimate.
- Profile C (balanced): Riegel/VDOT as-is.

If a value seems off (HR zone, max HR, race PR), VERIFY via
`get_athlete_profile` before reasoning further. Never carry forward a
Strava-derived zone into a coaching recommendation.
